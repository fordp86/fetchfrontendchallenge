# Frontend Code Challenge

#Hello Fetch Team, welcome to my sign up form! Thank you for taking the time to review my challenge.

#The form meets the following requirements.
-Display a form with inputs for each field outlined above
-Allow a user to complete and submit the form
-Do not allow form submission without completing the entire form
-Provide feedback upon successful form submission

#The form is written in React.js and React Bootstrap. I have choosen to use the following thrid party libraries in the project
-Axios
-React Bootstrap

#To start the project simply type npm start or npm run build from inside of the app-client directory

#The form uses React Bootstrap validaiton and Required fields to block a user from submitting an empty form. The form will also throw an error as an alert if their is an error submitting the form. If the form submits sucessfully the user will be redirected to a thank you page. The form should send a 201 response in postman.

#I really appreciate you asking me to complete this challenge and I know I will be a great fit to your team. I am willing to work hard and grow in my skills!

#Here is another project I worked on recently while learning more fullstack skills. I used Ionic React and Express.js with a team of 6 devs.
